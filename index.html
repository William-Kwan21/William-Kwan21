    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is William Kwan, and I am currently enrolled as a Sophomore in the Verazanno Honors Program at the College of Staten Island, where I am pursuing a major in Information Systems with a specialized focus on Cybersecurity. This academic pathway allows me to delve deeply into the intricate world of information technology, equipping me with the critical skills necessary to navigate and secure the digital landscape.

        Beyond my academic endeavors, I am passionately engaged in swimming, a discipline I have committed to since the tender age of six. As an integral member of the CSI swim team, I specialize in the 400 Individual Medley, 200 Individual Medley, and the 200 Breaststroke. This involvement not only showcases my dedication to excellence in physical pursuits but also contributes to my ability to work within and contribute to a team dynamically.

        In addition to my athletic commitments, I have a keen interest in digital entertainment, particularly in playing video games and watching anime. These activities provide a valuable outlet for relaxation and creativity, further enriching my personal and academic life by enhancing my analytical and strategic thinking skills.

    <p>
        Overall, my academic pursuits, coupled with my athletic and recreational activities, form a well-rounded profile, reflecting my dedication to both intellectual growth and personal development..
